1. **Compile the Program:**
   - In the terminal, use the following command to compile the *.c files:

     ```
     cc [FILENAME].c -o [FILENAME] cs50.c
     ```

     Replace `[FILENAME]` with the name of the file.

2. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the compiled program with the following command:

     ```
     ./[FILENAME]
     ```

     If you are playing the Wordle game, provide additional input for the word length. For example:

     ```
     ./wordle 5
     ```

     This indicates a word length of 5 characters. Adjust the number accordingly (e.g., `./wordle 6`, `./wordle 7`).
